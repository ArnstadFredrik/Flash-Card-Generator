## Flash Card Generator
This is a flash card generator I made for my hebrew studies.
- Options for sorting by comma or tab (tab i default)
- Option for font selection. Hebrew or greek fonts and standard sans-serif for "Norwegian" (hebrew is default)
- Option for adding border around each card (default no border)

The flash cards are generated in HTML and can be saved from the print dialog
